**An open-source library of `SKILL.md` playbooks for AI agents.** Browse and install on [skills.mercuryagent.sh](https://skills.mercuryagent.sh), or pull them directly from the [Mercury Agent](https://mercuryagent.sh) CLI.

**130 skills across 23 categories** — hand-curated, production-ready, and compatible with every major agent: Mercury, Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenClaw, Hermes, Cursor, and Gemini CLI.

---


### From the Mercury CLI (recommended)

```bash
# List what's available
mercury skills search "react patterns"


### From the web

Open [**skills.mercuryagent.sh**](https://skills.mercuryagent.sh), pick a skill, copy the install line for your agent — every skill page ships ready-made install steps for Mercury, Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Hermes, and "any other agent that understands SKILL.md".

### Clone the whole library

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trooprankrefinery/mercury-agent-skills-961
```

Drop individual skills into your agent's skills directory:

| Agent | Skills directory |
|---|---|
| **Mercury** | `~/.mercury/skills/` |
| **Claude Code** | `.claude/skills/` |
| **Codex CLI** | `.codex/skills/` |
| **OpenClaw** | `.openclaw/skills/` |
| **Hermes** | `.hermes/skills/` |
| **Cursor** | `.cursor/skills/` |
| **Gemini CLI** | `.gemini/skills/` |
| Any other | Wherever your agent reads `SKILL.md` from |

## Why Mercury Skills?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Curated, not crowded** | Every skill is hand-written against real workflows — no AI slop, no duplicates. |
| **Universal format** | One `SKILL.md` works in any agent that supports the standard. No per-agent forks. |
| **Discoverable** | Full-text search, categories, tags, leaderboard, and live JSON feed on [skills.mercuryagent.sh](https://skills.mercuryagent.sh). |
| **Installable** | One CLI command, no manual file copying. Atomic writes, version pinning, rollback on failure. |
| **Open** | MIT licensed. Contributions welcome via PR — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md). |

## Browse on the Web

[**skills.mercuryagent.sh**](https://skills.mercuryagent.sh) is the canonical browse-and-install surface for the library. It serves:

- A searchable, categorized index of every skill in this repo
- A trending leaderboard ranked by likes and installs
- Per-skill detail pages with the full `SKILL.md`, install steps for every supported agent, and a copy-paste-ready install command
- A bookmarking system so you can save skills for later (local, no account required)
- Social share cards with per-skill OpenGraph imagery

It also exposes a public JSON feed at [`/api/feed.json`](https://skills.mercuryagent.sh/api/feed.json) and per-skill JSON at `/api/skills/<category>/<slug>` for tooling builders.

## Skill Structure

Every skill is a single `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and a markdown body:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: 'What this skill does and when to use it'
metadata:
  author: cosmicstack-labs
  version: 1.0.0
  category: development
  tags: [clean-code, refactoring, best-practices]
---

# Skill Name

Full instructions, frameworks, scoring rubrics, and actionable guidance.
```

The format is intentionally minimal so any agent runtime can parse it without custom tooling. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the authoring standard.

## Try Mercury Agent

These skills are built for [**Mercury Agent**](https://mercuryagent.sh) — the agent runtime that consumes them natively.

- **Second Brain** — persistent memory that learns from every session
- **Skill system** — load, version, and update skills from this registry directly
- **Permission guardrails** — safe by design, auditable by default
- **Token budgets** — keep AI spend predictable
- **Multi-channel** — CLI, Telegram, and web; same agent, same memory

```bash

# Pull a skill into your agent
mercury skills install ai-ml/prompt-engineering

# Browse what you have
mercury skills list
```
